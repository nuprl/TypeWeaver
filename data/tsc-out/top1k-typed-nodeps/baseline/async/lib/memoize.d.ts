/**
 * Caches the results of an async function. When creating a hash to store
 * function results against, the callback is omitted from the hash and an
 * optional hash function can be used.
 *
 * **Note: if the async function errs, the result will not be cached and
 * subsequent calls will call the wrapped function.**
 *
 * If no hash function is specified, the first argument is used as a hash key,
 * which may work reasonably if it is a string or a data type that converts to a
 * distinct string. Note that objects and arrays will not behave reasonably.
 * Neither will cases where the other arguments are significant. In such cases,
 * specify your own hash function.
 *
 * The cache of results is exposed as the `memo` property of the function
 * returned by `memoize`.

 * @param {AsyncFunction} fn - The async function to proxy and cache results from.
 * @param {Function} hasher - An optional function for generating a custom hash
 * for storing results. It has all the arguments applied to it apart from the
 * callback, and must be synchronous.
 * @returns {AsyncFunction} a memoized version of `fn`
 * @example
 *
 * var slow_fn = function(name, callback) {
 *     // do something
 *     callback(null, result);
 * };
 * var fn = async.memoize(slow_fn);
 *
 * // fn can now be used as if it were slow_fn
 * fn('some name', function() {
 *     // callback
 * });
