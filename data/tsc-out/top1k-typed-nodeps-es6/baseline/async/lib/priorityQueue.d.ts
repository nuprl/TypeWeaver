/**
 * The same as [async.queue]{@link module:ControlFlow.queue} only tasks are assigned a priority and

 * @category Control Flow
 * @param {AsyncFunction} worker - An async function for processing a queued task.
 * If you want to handle errors from an individual task, pass a callback to
 * `q.push()`.
 * Invoked with (task, callback).
 * @param {number} concurrency - An `integer` for determining how many `worker`
 * functions should be run in parallel.  If omitted, the concurrency defaults to
 * `1`.  If the concurrency is `0`, an error is thrown.
 * @returns {module:ControlFlow.QueueObject} A priorityQueue object to manage the tasks. There are three
 * differences between `queue` and `priorityQueue` objects:
 * * `push(task, priority, [callback])` - `priority` should be a number. If an
 *   array of `tasks` is given, all tasks will be assigned the same priority.
 * * `pushAsync(task, priority, [callback])` - the same as `priorityQueue.push`,
 *   except this returns a promise that rejects if an error occurs.
 * * The `unshift` and `unshiftAsync` methods were removed.
