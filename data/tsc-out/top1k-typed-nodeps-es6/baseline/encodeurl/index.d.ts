 * Encode a URL to a percent-encoded form, excluding already-encoded sequences.

 * code points. This function will not encode the "%" character unless it is
 * not part of a valid sequence (`%20` will be left as-is, but `%foo` will
 * be encoded as `%25foo`).
 *
 * This encode is meant to be "safe" and does not throw errors. It will try as
 * hard as it can to properly encode the given URL, including replacing any raw,
 * unpaired surrogate pairs with the Unicode replacement character prior to
 * encoding.
