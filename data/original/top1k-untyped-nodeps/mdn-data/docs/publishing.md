# Publishing a new version of MDN `mdn-data`

Repo admins publish new releases of [mdn-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdn-data) on npm. This is then used by MDN to generate various sidebars as well as other things.

Any admin can complete the following steps to publish a new version, but please coordinate releases with [@ddbeck](https://github.com/ddbeck) or [@Rumyra](https://github.com/Rumyra).

The steps in this process assume:

- `NPM_TOKEN` is set in the repository secrets. If the token is invalidated or unset, a member of the `@mdn` organization on npm must [create a new token](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-authentication-tokens) and [add it to the repository's secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

## Prepare for the release

Prepare for a release by creating a pull request to update metadata for the release. See [#507](https://github.com/mdn/data/pull/507) as an example.

1. Start a new branch for the upcoming release. For example, run `git switch -c release-YYYY-MM-DD`, where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the target release date.

2. Increment the package version with `npm version --no-git-tag-version` and commit the change.

   For example, to increment the version for a routine data update with no breaking changes or new features, run `npm version --no-git-tag-version patch`, then commit the changes to the package metadata files.

   If needed, you can repeat this step on the same branch, using a `minor` or `major` argument (instead of `patch`), to increment the version for newly-introduced features or breaking changes.

3. Push the release branch to your remote, open a pull request, and then review/merge it.

## Publish to npm

1. Start a draft [release on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/data/releases).

   - In the _Tag version_ and _Release title_ fields, enter `vX.Y.Z` where `X.Y.Z` is the version number you'd like to publish. Do not use an existing value, but instead
   select an increment from the previous release. For example, if the previous release
   was `v2.0.20`, use `v2.0.21` for the _Tag version_ and _Release title_ fields.
   - You can leave the _Describe this release_ field blank, or add notes as you wish.

   _Note_: If you're not ready to publish to npm, click **Save draft** in GitHub and resume this process later.

2. Click **Publish release** to create the tag and trigger the workflow that publishes to npm. Wait for the [`npm publish` GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/mdn/data/actions/workflows/npm-publish.yml) to finish successfully.

3. Check [`mdn-data` on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdn-data) to see if the release shows up correctly.

The package is now published. ðŸŽ‰
