index.ts(9,35): error TS2769: No overload matches this call.
  Overload 1 of 3, '(target: (this: ObjectConstructor, ...args: readonly unknown[]) => unknown, thisArg: ObjectConstructor): (...args: readonly unknown[]) => unknown', gave the following error.
    Argument of type 'Object' is not assignable to parameter of type '(this: ObjectConstructor, ...args: readonly unknown[]) => unknown'.
      The 'Object' type is assignable to very few other types. Did you mean to use the 'any' type instead?
        Type 'Object' provides no match for the signature '(this: ObjectConstructor, ...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown'.
  Overload 2 of 3, '(originalFunction: (this: ObjectConstructor, ...args: readonly unknown[]) => unknown, thisArg: ObjectConstructor): (...args: readonly unknown[]) => unknown', gave the following error.

shim.ts(9,3): error TS2322: Type '() => Boolean' is not assignable to type '() => boolean'.
  Type 'Boolean' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
    'boolean' is a primitive, but 'Boolean' is a wrapper object. Prefer using 'boolean' when possible.
shim.ts(10,11): error TS2367: This condition will always return 'true' since the types '{ <T>(o: { [s: string]: T; } | ArrayLike<T>): T[]; (o: {}): any[]; }' and 'String' have no overlap.
shim.ts(13,2): error TS2322: Type 'String' is not assignable to type 'Boolean'.
  The types returned by 'valueOf()' are incompatible between these types.
    Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
