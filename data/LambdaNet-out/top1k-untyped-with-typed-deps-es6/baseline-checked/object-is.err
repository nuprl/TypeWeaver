index.ts(9,35): error TS2769: No overload matches this call.
  Overload 1 of 3, '(target: (this: ObjectConstructor, ...args: readonly unknown[]) => unknown, thisArg: ObjectConstructor): (...args: readonly unknown[]) => unknown', gave the following error.
    Argument of type 'Object' is not assignable to parameter of type '(this: ObjectConstructor, ...args: readonly unknown[]) => unknown'.
      The 'Object' type is assignable to very few other types. Did you mean to use the 'any' type instead?
        Type 'Object' provides no match for the signature '(this: ObjectConstructor, ...args: readonly unknown[]): unknown'.
  Overload 2 of 3, '(originalFunction: (this: ObjectConstructor, ...args: readonly unknown[]) => unknown, thisArg: ObjectConstructor): (...args: readonly unknown[]) => unknown', gave the following error.
    Argument of type 'Object' is not assignable to parameter of type '(this: ObjectConstructor, ...args: readonly unknown[]) => unknown'.

shim.ts(7,6): error TS2696: The 'Object' type is assignable to very few other types. Did you mean to use the 'any' type instead?
  The types returned by 'valueOf()' are incompatible between these types.
    Type 'Object' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
shim.ts(9,3): error TS2322: Type '() => Boolean' is not assignable to type '() => boolean'.
  Type 'Boolean' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
    'boolean' is a primitive, but 'Boolean' is a wrapper object. Prefer using 'boolean' when possible.
shim.ts(10,11): error TS2367: This condition will always return 'true' since the types '(value1: any, value2: any) => boolean' and 'Boolean' have no overlap.
