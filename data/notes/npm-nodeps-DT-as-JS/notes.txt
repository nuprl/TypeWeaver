# Type inference

This directory is almost identical to `npm-nodeps-DT-output`, except that
DeepTyper was modified to use a JavaScript lexer, instead of a TypeScript lexer.

The type inference was done by executing:

    # starting from the repository root
    cd data/notes/npm-nodeps-DT-as-JS
    python ../../../tools/infer-types.py ../../npm-nodeps-DT-as-JS

2500 `*.js` files were given as inputs.

2467 files ran successfully.

33 files resulted in an error.


# Type insertion

Took about 20 minutes
2105 successes
362 failures
all errors are the same
still have misalignment issues
but using the JS lexer seems to be more helpful?
