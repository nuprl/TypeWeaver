The `npm-nodeps` directory (or tarball) contains a set of "no dependencies"
packages downloaded from NPM, filtered from the top 1000 most downloaded
packages.

"No dependencies" means the `package.json` file has the line:

    "dependencies": {}

There are 71 packages, taking up 40 MB of disk space.

There are 6357 files total. 2500 are `*.js`, 1175 are `*.d.ts` (which are
generated by the TypeScript compiler and only contain declarations), 2 are
`*.ts`

The two `*.ts` files are:
  - loglevel/test/type-test.ts
  - dotenv/types/test.ts


NOTE: A more robust search reveals more packages with no dependencies.

This is because the line:

    "dependencies": {}

may be split over multiple lines; in fact, there were 2 packages where this
was the case (`imurmurhash` and `json-stable-stringify-without-jsonify`).

Furthermore, there were 358 packages that simply do not have the "dependencies"
line in their `package.json` file.

This brings the total number of "no dependencies" packages (from the top1k
dataset) to 431. These are listed in the file `full-list.txt`.
