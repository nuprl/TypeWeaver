The `top1k-plus` directory (or tarball) contains the top 1000 most downloaded
packages from NPM, plus additional dependencies to ensure the set is closed.
In other words, all the packages in this dataset either have no dependencies, or
depend on a set of packages that are also in that dataset.

The download stats were scraped from NPM around August 2021. No packages were
filtered out. Each package was downloaded as a tarball; the tarball was what
the package author uploaded to NPM, which might not correspond to the package's
GitHub repository. NPM does not do any validation or curation on the tarballs.

There are 1147 packages in this set.

Dependencies were obtained by examining the `package.json` files.
devDependencies and version numbers were ignored.

Using jq (https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), these were the approximate steps:

    ls > pkgs
    for i in `find . -type f -name "package.json"`; do \
        jq -r '.dependencies | keys | join("\n")' $i >> deps; \
    done
    cat deps | sort | uniq > deps_sorted
    diff pkgs deps_sorted | grep ">" | cut -d" " -f2

These steps were repeated until no more new dependencies were discovered.
