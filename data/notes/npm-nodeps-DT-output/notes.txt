This directory is a copy of `npm-nodeps`, but with TypeScript files generated
by DeepTyper. The type inference was done with commands similar to:

    # starting from the repository root
    cd DeepTyper/pretrained
    find ../../data/npm-nodeps-DT-output/ \
      -type f \
      -name "*.js" \
      -exec python readout.py {} \;

There are 8824 files total, taking up 51 MB of space. It took about 2 hours
(with an RTX6000) to run the type inference.

2500 `*.js` files were given as inputs; these are listed in `type-inf-inputs`.

2467 `*.ts` files were produced; these are listed in `type-inf-outputs`.

33 files resulted in an error; these are listed in `type-inf-fail`.

27 error messages are recorded in `type-inf-errs`; 6 errors are unaccounted for.
