# Type inference

This directory is almost identical to `npm-nodeps-DT-output`, except that
DeepTyper was modified to use a JavaScript lexer, instead of a TypeScript lexer.

The type inference was done by executing:

    # starting from the repository root
    cd data/notes/npm-nodeps-DT-as-JS
    python ../../../tools/infer-types.py ../../npm-nodeps-DT-as-JS

2500 `*.js` files were given as inputs. It took about 135 minutes to run.

2467 files ran successfully.

33 files resulted in an error.


# Type insertion

    cd data/notes/npm-nodeps-DT-as-JS
    python ../../../tools/insert-types.py ../../npm-nodeps-DT-as-JS

This took about 2 minutes.

All 2467 files ran successfully. There were 0 failures and 0 errors.

However, there were 614 warnings in 125 files. Compared to
`npm-nodeps-DT-output`, the only difference is a single warning, caused by
DeepTyper using the TypeScript lexer and incorrectly tokenizing a file. Using
the JavaScript lexer avoids this warning.


# Type checking

    cd data/notes/npm-nodeps-DT-as-JS
    python ../../../tools/check-types.py ../../npm-nodeps-DT-as-JS

This took about 15 minutes.

There were 2467 inputs.

348 type checked successfully. 2119 failed to type check.
